24comments
Overview

24comments is a community-driven project aimed at gathering and analyzing Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) comments from live YouTube streams from the 2024 election. The goal is to collect data from various streams, compare the results, and observe how viewer sentiments shift over time, especially in relation to other channels.

Currently it just monitors "bigger" outlets, I'd be up to accepting comments from other streams.

Features

    Collect comments from live YouTube streams in real-time.
    Store and organize collected comments for analysis.
    Compare comments from different streams to identify trends and shifts in viewer sentiment.
    Community-driven: everyone can run the software and contribute to the data collection.

Simple: Does what it says on the box, no configuration neccesary.
The script installs the necessary dependencies (screen and pytchat) and creates Python scripts to monitor live YouTube streams for comments. It sets up individual monitoring scripts for specific YouTube video IDs, each script collecting comments in real-time and saving them to CSV files. The script then starts separate screen sessions for each monitoring script, allowing them to run concurrently in the background. This setup enables the collection and comparison of comments from multiple live streams simultaneously.

Custom: Set your own streams and sources
